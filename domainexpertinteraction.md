## Domain Context and Terminology

**How would you describe the overall purpose of this problem statement in your daily work?**

The platform aims to solve the critical speed versus quality trade-off in the gig economy by creating a specialized marketplace that connects early-stage startups and lean teams with a hybrid workforce of skilled students and industry professionals. The focus is on specific, outcome-driven tasks (like building landing pages, designing pitch decks, creating product assets) rather than open-ended employment, addressing the bottleneck where traditional hiring is too slow and large platforms like Upwork are too noisy or expensive.

**What are the primary goals or outcomes of this problem statement?**

1. Enable startups to get specific tasks completed quickly without full-time hiring
2. Provide real project exposure and portfolio-building opportunities for creators/students
3. Create a frictionless hiring and working experience for small, real-world tasks
4. Solve discoverability and credibility issues for emerging talent
5. Bridge the gap between startup needs (fast execution) and talent availability (real work opportunities)

## Core workflows

### Workflow 1: Gig Worker Onboarding and Service Posting
**Trigger/start condition:** New candidate registers on the platform

**Steps involved:**  
1. Candidate creates profile with basic information (personal details, experience, education)  
2. Candidate posts services they offer with detailed descriptions (e.g., "I will build a landing page", "I will design a logo", "I will write blog content")  
3. Candidate lists their skills, tools, and expertise for each service  
4. Candidate uploads portfolio items showcasing past work related to posted services  
5. Candidate sets pricing, delivery time, and service packages for their offerings  
6. Platform verifies profile through manual or automated checks (profile completeness, document verification, sample work review)  
7. Candidates who meet quality criteria are approved and their service posts go live  
8. Candidates who do not meet requirements are filtered out  
9. Approved workers' service posts become discoverable to clients browsing the platform

**Outcome/End condition:** Verified gig worker has active service posts visible on the platform for clients to discover and request

### Workflow 2: Client Service Discovery and Work Request
**Trigger/start condition:** Client needs a specific service completed (e.g., landing page, logo design, content writing)

**Steps involved (in order):**
1. Client browses the platform to view posted services by creators
2. System shows service posts matching the client's needs based on categories/skills
3. Client reviews service posts, including descriptions, portfolios, pricing, delivery time, and creator ratings
4. Client filters services based on ratings, experience, portfolio quality, price, and delivery time
5. Client selects a service post from their preferred creator
6. Client requests work from the creator by initiating contact through the service post
7. Creator receives work request notification from the client
8. Communication SOP is followed for discussing project details and requirements
9. Client and creator confirm deliverables, timeline, and payment terms
10. Creator delivers work according to agreed specifications
11. Client reviews and approves deliverable
12. Payment is processed according to defined payment cycle
13. Both parties leave testimonials/reviews

**Outcome/End condition:** Client successfully requests and receives service from creator's posted offering, payment is processed, and both parties have updated profiles with testimonials

### Workflow 3: Bulk Hiring/Organization Management
**Trigger/start condition:** Organization needs multiple gig workers for mass hiring (e.g., audit team, promotional events)

**Steps involved:**  
1. Manager logs into dashboard  
2. Manager posts multiple requirements  
3. Platform sources candidates  
4. Candidates undergo onboarding and verification  
5. Manager tracks progress  
6. Approved candidates assigned  
7. Work completed  
8. Payments managed in bulk  
9. Performance data collected

**Outcome/End condition:** Organization successfully staffs multiple positions with verified gig workers, all tracked through single management interface

## Rules, Constraints, and Exceptions

**Mandatory rules or policies:**
- All workers must complete profile verification before being activated  
- Payment cycles must be clearly defined and communicated upfront  
- SOPs must be followed for all client communication  
- Testimonials are mandatory for both clients and gig workers  
- Referral system is mandatory for gig workers

**Constraints or limitations:**
- Sourcing workers in areas with low digital literacy or small registered user base is challenging
- Getting demand (clients) is more difficult than getting supply (workers) for new platforms
- Platform focuses on limited scope, standardized tasks rather than open-ended employment
- Quality consistency requires ongoing filtering and verification processes

**Common exceptions or edge cases:**
- Remote locations where no qualified workers are available despite marketing efforts
- Clients with highly customized requirements that don't fit standardized task templates
- Urgent requirements that bypass normal matching timelines
- Workers performing well in practice but filtered initially
- Bulk hiring scenarios requiring different approval/management workflows

**Situations where things usually go wrong:**
- Quality issues when adequate verification is not conducted during onboarding
- Communication breakdowns when SOP is not clearly defined or followed
- Client dissatisfaction when platform tries to be everything to everyone instead of specializing in niche services
- Payment disputes when payment cycles and terms are not clearly communicated upfront
- Worker retention issues without proper support systems (cloud calling, help desk)

## Current challenges and pain points

**What parts of this process are most difficult or inefficient?**
- Acquiring clients (demand) is significantly harder than recruiting gig workers (supply), especially for new platforms
- Maintaining consistent quality across a large, distributed workforce
- Competing with established platforms (like Upwork & fiverr) that have brand recognition but suffer from noise and high costs
- Balancing platform standardization with client customization needs

**Where do delays, errors, or misunderstandings usually occur?**
- Communication gaps when SOP is not well-defined across departments
- Sourcing delays in remote or low-connectivity areas
- Matching errors when candidate skills don't align with actual task requirements
- Payment disputes when cycles and terms are unclear from the start

## Assumptions & Clarifications

**What assumptions made by the team that were confirmed:**
- Startups need fast execution for specific tasks rather than full-time hires
- Quality verification through testing during onboarding is essential
- Separate dashboards/portals for bulk hiring management are valuable
- Testimonial systems work for both clients and workers
- Support systems (like cloud calling) significantly improve user experience

**Open questions that need follow-up:**
- Specific metrics or KPIs for measuring worker quality.
- Detailed SOP documentation for communication workflow across all touchpoints
- Pricing strategy for competing with established platforms while maintaining quality
- Technology stack and implementation details for aptitude testing system
- Specific strategies for targeting and acquiring initial startup clients (demand generation)
- Integration requirements for cloud calling support system
- Data privacy and security considerations for client and worker information
