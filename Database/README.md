Gig Marketplace Platform — ER Model

A normalized database design for a two-sided gig marketplace where clients post tasks and gig professionals apply to complete them.

Overview

The platform follows a task-based marketplace model rather than a service listing system. Clients post tasks, gig professionals apply, and the platform manages the lifecycle from application → hiring → deliverable → payment → review.

The schema is normalized to Third Normal Form (3NF) and supports:

Individual and organization-based hiring

Optional manager accounts for delegated hiring

End-to-end task lifecycle tracking

Bidirectional reviews after task completion

Entities

The system consists of the following core entities:

USERS

CLIENT

ORGANIZATION

MANAGER

GIG_PROFESSIONAL_PROFILE

PROFILE_SKILLS

PROFILE_TOOLS

PROFILE_PORTFOLIO

TASKS

APPLICATION

DELIVERABLES

PAYMENTS

REVIEWS

Attributes and constraints for these entities are defined in the ER diagram.

Relationships

Key relationships in the system include:

USERS may act as CLIENTS or GIG PROFESSIONALS

CLIENTS post TASKS

CLIENTS may optionally create MANAGER accounts

ORGANIZATIONS group multiple CLIENT accounts

GIG PROFESSIONALS apply to TASKS through APPLICATION

Accepted applications produce DELIVERABLES

Approved deliverables generate PAYMENTS

Both parties can leave REVIEWS after task completion

GIG PROFESSIONAL profiles maintain SKILLS, TOOLS, and PORTFOLIO links

Normalization
First Normal Form (1NF)

GIG_PROFESSIONAL_PROFILE originally contained multi-valued attributes (skills, tools, portfolio_links).

These were decomposed into:

PROFILE_SKILLS

PROFILE_TOOLS

PROFILE_PORTFOLIO

Each row now stores one value only, satisfying atomicity.

Second Normal Form (2NF)

Relations with composite keys were evaluated for partial dependencies:

PROFILE_SKILLS

PROFILE_TOOLS

APPLICATION

REVIEWS

No partial dependencies were found, so all relations satisfy 2NF.

Third Normal Form (3NF)

A transitive dependency existed between client and organization data:

client_id → org_id → root_client_id
manager_id → org_id → root_client_id

To remove this dependency, a separate ORGANIZATION entity was introduced.
CLIENT and MANAGER now reference org_id via foreign keys.

All relations are therefore in 3NF.

Functional Dependencies
USERS
user_id → name, email, password_hash, role, created_at
email → user_id
CLIENT
client_id → user_id, org_id, type
user_id → client_id
ORGANIZATION
org_id → org_name, root_client_id
MANAGER
manager_id → org_id, current_profiles_managed
GIG_PROFESSIONAL_PROFILE
gig_profile_id → user_id, bio, rating
user_id → gig_profile_id
TASKS
task_id → client_id, manager_id, title, description, budget, timeline, status
APPLICATION
application_id → gig_profile_id, task_id, status, created_at
(gig_profile_id, task_id) → status, created_at
DELIVERABLES
deliverable_id → task_id, gig_profile_id, submission_link, status, created_at
task_id → deliverable_id
PAYMENTS
payment_id → task_id, client_id, gig_profile_id, amount, due_date, status
task_id → payment_id
REVIEWS
review_id → reviewer_id, reviewee_id, task_id, rating, comment
(reviewer_id, task_id) → rating, comment
Design Decisions

Manager accounts are optional. Root clients can perform all manager actions directly.

APPLICATION acts as an aggregation entity between profiles and tasks.

ORGANIZATION was introduced during normalization to eliminate transitive dependencies.

One task produces at most one deliverable and one payment.

Skills, tools, and portfolio links are stored in separate tables due to 1NF decomposition.

Future Extensions

Potential improvements for future versions include:

Messaging between clients and gig professionals

Notification system for task and payment updates

Standardized skill taxonomy

Escrow-based milestone payments

Platform analytics and performance metrics
