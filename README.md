## Problem Statement

Managing the onboarding and profile system of gig workers for a specialized marketplace connecting early-stage startups with skilled talent for short-term, outcome-driven tasks.

**For Startups:**
- Need specific tasks completed quickly (landing pages, pitch decks, product assets)
- Traditional hiring is too slow and expensive for short-term work
- Large platforms like Upwork are noisy, resume-heavy, and often too expensive

**For Creators and Gig Workers:**
- Talented students and professionals struggle with discoverability
- Limited opportunities to build portfolios with real startup projects
- No structured way to establish credibility and convert skills into opportunities

**The Gap**: Startups need fast execution of small tasks with quality outcomes, while talent wants real project work and portfolio building. Traditional platforms fail to bridge this gap efficiently.

2. **Standardized Workflows**: Clear SOPs from requirement posting to completion
